Mobile Native capabilities for barcode scanning are defined as follows:

## Mobile Capabilities APIs

### Module Structure

The Mobile Capabilities APIs are organized in a hierarchical structure:

- \`lightning/mobileCapabilities\`: Main entry point for mobile capabilities in Lightning Web Components
- Individual service modules: Each providing specific device functionality
- \`BaseCapability\`: Common interface providing core functionality

### Base Capability

All mobile capability services extend the \`BaseCapability\` interface:

\`\`\`typescript
/**
 * Provide all services with common functionalities.
 */
export interface BaseCapability {
  /**
   * Use this function to determine whether the respective service functionality is available.
   * @returns Returns true when used on a supported device and false otherwise.
   */

#### Current Implementation Notes

1. **Type System**:

   - The JavaScript implementation provides runtime functionality
   - TypeScript declarations provide compile-time type checking
   - Both systems coexist to provide both runtime behavior and type safety

2. **Error Handling**:

   - JavaScript implementation uses a callback-based error handling pattern
   - TypeScript declarations define specific error types and codes
   - Both systems work together to provide error information

3. **Method Availability**:

   - All methods defined in TypeScript are implemented in JavaScript
   - Deprecated methods are marked in both systems
   - Implementation matches the type definitions

4. **Options Handling**:
   - JavaScript implementation accepts options as defined in TypeScript
   - TypeScript provides detailed documentation of option defaults
   - Implementation follows the type definitions

### Current Implementation Notes

1. **Type System**:

   - JavaScript implementation provides runtime location services
   - TypeScript declarations define the location interface
   - Both systems work together to provide type-safe location operations

2. **Error Handling**:

   - JavaScript uses Promise-based error handling for \`getCurrentPosition\`
   - Callback-based error handling for \`startWatchingPosition\`
   - TypeScript defines comprehensive error codes and messages
   - Implementation follows the type definitions for error handling

3. **Method Availability**:

   - All methods defined in TypeScript are implemented in JavaScript
   - Implementation matches the type definitions
   - Both systems provide consistent functionality

4. **Data Structures**:

   - JavaScript implementation works with location objects
   - TypeScript provides detailed type definitions for coordinates and options
   - Implementation follows the type definitions for all data structures

5. **Platform-Specific Features**:

   - Android-specific permission rationale text support
   - Platform-specific error codes (e.g., LOCATION_SERVICE_DISABLED for Android)
   - Consistent interface across platforms with platform-specific optimizations

6. **Accuracy Control**:

   - Supports both high and normal accuracy modes
   - High accuracy prioritizes precision over battery life
   - Normal accuracy balances battery life and response time
