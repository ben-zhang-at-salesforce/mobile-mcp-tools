# Proof of Life: Contact List Mobile App - Implementation Plan

## Overview

**This is a living document** that outlines the specific implementation requirements for our first technology preview iteration: an end-to-end workflow that transforms a user utterance into a functioning mobile app displaying a list of Salesforce Contacts.

**Current Iteration Scope**: This first iteration of the document represents a waypoint to define the basic scaffolding of a "happy path" end-to-end flow. It by no means fully defines the end deliverable for customers, but rather establishes the foundational workflow and tooling architecture.

**Evolution Plan**: As we evolve past our proof-of-life iteration, we will evolve this document to flesh out the necessary features for our next steps. The purpose of this document is to:

- Cover the work we're doing right now
- Evolve to reflect the details of the work to come
- Maintain a living reference for implementation teams

**Alignment Note**: This implementation plan directly implements the principles and architecture outlined in [`5_mobile_native_app_generation.md`](./5_mobile_native_app_generation.md), serving as a concrete proof-of-concept for the instruction-first, three-phase workflow approach.

## Success Criteria

**User Journey**: From utterance _"I want an iOS mobile app that will show me a list of all of my Salesforce Contacts"_ to a running mobile app displaying Contacts in a simulator/emulator.

**Technical Validation**: Demonstrates instruction-first MCP tools successfully guiding an LLM through the complete Plan → Design/Iterate → Run workflow.

1. **Template Discovery**: Call `sfmobile-native-template-discovery` with specified platform
   - Use identified features to filter templates by tags
   - Match user requirements to template capabilities
2. **Project Generation**: Call `sfmobile-native-project-generation` with selected template
3. **Build Validation**: Call `sfmobile-native-build-validation` to verify base project
   → **Checkpoint**: Working skeletal app that builds successfully

### Phase 2: Design/Iterate

4. **Code Analysis**: Call `sfmobile-native-code-analysis` to understand template structure
5. **Feature Modification**: Call `sfmobile-native-feature-modification` to adapt for user's specific record type
6. **Iterative Testing**: Build and validate changes incrementally
   → **Checkpoint**: App displays user's requested data/functionality

### Phase 3: Run

7. **Deployment**: Call `sfmobile-native-deployment` to launch on simulator/emulator
   → **Final Checkpoint**: User can interact with functioning app

**Next Step**: Begin by analyzing the user request, then start with `sfmobile-native-template-discovery`

## Template Repository Integration

### Git Submodule Design

**Architecture Decision**: The `@salesforce/mobile-native-mcp-server` package includes the official [SalesforceMobileSDK-Templates](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-Templates) repository as a Git submodule located at `<ServerRoot>/resources/SalesforceMobileSDK-Templates/`, serving as the primary template source with architecture designed to support additional template repositories in future iterations.

**Template Discovery Process**:

1. `sfmobile-native-template-discovery` tool uses `sfdx-mobilesdk-plugin` CLI commands
2. Executes platform-specific commands: `sf mobilesdk ios|android listtemplates --templatesource=<ServerRoot>/resources/SalesforceMobileSDK-Templates --doc --json` for comprehensive template information
3. Parses structured JSON output including descriptions, use cases, features arrays, complexity ratings, and list of customization points
4. Optionally uses platform-specific commands: `sf mobilesdk ios|android listtemplate --template=<TemplateName> --doc --json` for detailed template investigation
5. Returns template selection guidance to LLM with rich metadata and extensible architecture for future template repositories

**Integration with CLI Tools**:

- `sfdx-mobilesdk-plugin` CLI commands reference the local submodule path as template source
- Templates are immediately available for project generation without additional downloads
- Consistent with standard Mobile SDK development workflows

### Workflow State Management and Orchestration _(Advanced Workflow Features)_

**Priority**: Post-steel thread implementation - advanced workflow integrity features

**Core Challenge**: How do we ensure workflow integrity, validate tool execution order, and maintain state across the three-phase workflow while preserving instruction-first principles?

**Key Requirements to Address**:

1. **Workflow State Verification**: Mechanisms to verify the veracity of workflow state as tools execute and ensure tools are called in correct sequence with prerequisites met
2. **Out-of-Order Tool Execution**: Detection and graceful handling when downstream tools are called without prerequisite workflow steps
3. **State Persistence Strategy**: Robust workflow state maintenance across tool calls

**Potential Implementation Approaches**:

- **File-System Workflow Status**: Maintain quasi-ephemeral documented workflow status on the file system that each tool refers to for status validation and updates with execution results. Benefits: Avoids polluting input/output schemas, provides persistent state across tool calls, enables debugging and workflow introspection.
- **Data Structure State Passing**: Represent orchestration status as a data structure passed from tool input to output. Benefits: Explicit state management, no file system dependencies. Concerns: Schema pollution, complexity in tool interfaces.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combination of file-system state with selective data structure passing for critical workflow checkpoints.

**Error Handling and Recovery**:

- **Workflow Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling approach for adverse cases, including ability to redirect users to appropriate workflow restart points
- **Graceful Degradation**: Clear guidance when workflow prerequisites aren't met, up to and including restarting from workflow beginning
- **State Repair**: Mechanisms for recovering from corrupted or incomplete workflow state

**Implementation Considerations**:

- **Tool Interface Design**: Integration of workflow state checking with instruction-first tool design without compromising LLM guidance principles
- **Performance Impact**: Minimizing overhead of state management on tool execution speed
- **User Experience**: Transparent workflow progress indication and error recovery without exposing internal state management complexity
- **Debugging Support**: Workflow state visibility for development and troubleshooting scenarios
