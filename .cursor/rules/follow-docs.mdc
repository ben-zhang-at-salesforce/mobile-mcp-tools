## Documentation Requirements

When adding new features or making schema changes, you must:

1. **Review existing documentation** in `/docs` to understand the current structure and standards
2. **Follow established patterns** from existing documentation when implementing new features
3. **Reference relevant documentation** sections when making changes to ensure consistency

## Documentation Structure

The project maintains documentation under `/docs/` with the following structure:

- `/docs/current/` - Current project documentation
- `/docs/archived/` - Historical documentation
- `/docs/resources/` - Supporting resources and schemas

## Feature Development Guidelines

### Before Adding New Features:

1. Check if documentation exists in `/docs/current/` for similar features
2. Review any relevant schemas in `/docs/resources/`
3. Understand the overall project structure from `/docs/current/README.md`

### When Adding New Features:

1. If the feature has no existing documentation, **prompt the user**:
   "I notice this new feature doesn't have documentation in `/docs/current/`. Would you like me to create documentation for this feature to maintain consistency with the project's documentation standards?"

2. If documentation exists for similar features, follow those patterns and update relevant sections

### Schema Changes:

1. Always check `/docs/resources/` for existing schemas before making changes
2. Update any relevant documentation in `/docs/current/` when schemas change
3. Ensure schema changes are reflected in any related documentation

## Documentation Standards

- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Use consistent formatting and structure
- Reference the main project documentation when implementing features
- Maintain clear examples and usage patterns
